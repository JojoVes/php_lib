# PHP Lib

## Introduction

PHP Lib is a collection of interfaces, classes and functions that are used by a
variety of Islandora modules, most notably the Forms modules. It is used
primarily to create pages that convert records in XML formats to a more
human-readable version that is also able to be easily manipulated. This is done
by a series of PHP files that Drupal includes when loading these pages.
